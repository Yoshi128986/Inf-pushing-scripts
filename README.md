# Inf-pushing-scripts
Have era surge/burst off also don't have no bounds or crit wave jump
This is a set of infinity pushing scripts that I made for 12h, 24h, 72h, and 192h runs.
Note that it may take multiple tries for the AI to not die.
In the "Start of pushing" script you MUST replace the ****imput time interval here (12h, 24h, 72h, 192h)**** in line 9 with the time you want DO NOT remove the "autopush".
Note that era floor should be on.
Also note that the script starts in the town.
Use Joking's BP.
800x600 is a resolution that will work but you can use any one with an aspect ratio of 4:3.
