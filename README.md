# Inf-pushing-scripts
This is a set of infinity pushing scripts that I made for 12h, 24h, 72h, and 192h runs.
Note that it may take multiple tries for the AI to not die.
In the "Start of pushing" script you MUST replace the ****imput time interval here (12h, 24h, 72h, 192h)**** in line 9 with the time you want DO NOT remove the "autopush".
Note that era floor should be on
Also note that the script starts in the town
Use Joking's BP
384h run functionality now! After the update it will get you to 10b infs, note that it is named differently
